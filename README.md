# Supermarket Kata - Java
The start of the classic supermarket kata, in Java/Eclipse with JUnit

The problem centres on a supermarket that sells six different items:

Item | Price
-----------|---------
Tin of beans | 40p
Tin of soup	| 90p
Tin of peaches | 55p
Coleslaw | 50p
Bag of Roman salad | £1.50
Bag of Spring Fresh salad | £1.50

Now change the function to support the following needs:

1. Look at PriceListTests. There are tests for four items. Write tests for the remaining two. 
2. write a function that, given a basket of goods, returns the sum to be paid at the checkout.
Use the following prices:2.	The supermarket is offering a 1/3 reduction on coleslaw. 
3.	The supermarket is having a promotion on tinned goods, offering 3 for 2 on all tinned produce. The offer is only for 3 tins of the same thing. 
4.	The supermarket is now selling fresh peaches at £1.99/kg.
5.	Customers whose shopping comes to more than £20 now get a 10% discount. This offer is not available with the 3 for 2 offer on tins.
6.	The supermarket is offering 2 for one on all bags of salad. With this offer you can mix and match.
